# FODA---Project-2021
This will be used as for demonstrating simple linear regression in Python

### Problem Statement
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis. Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:  

1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.  
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.  
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.  

To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.

### Project Management
1. There needs to be a full and complete review of all the materila from the FODA coursework completed before progressing with this task
2. There needs to be a complete review of the following:
 - Linear Regression Analysis
 - Numpy Package
 - Seaborn Package
 - MaptPlotLib Package
 - SKLearn Package
 - Jupyter Notebook Standards
 - MarkDown File Standards
 - Machine Learning and where it overlaps with the Linear regression Analyslis.

3. Follow Up Research Required:  
 - Polynomial Regresssion Analysis  
 - Cubic Regression Analysis  
 - Machine Learning in SKLearn  

###  Runnnig the Code: 
 - Full desription of the problem statement to be added.    
 - Clearly list all software and libraries required.   
 - Structure of the overall analysis  
 - Import all the libraries that are explicitly called out in code block at the commencement of this data  
 - once this has been completed, allow for the pandas package to read in the csv file that is taken from the URL provided. Failing that, there is a copy of the dataset in this repository.   
 - Adjust the style of the seaborn package to fully leveratge the readability.   
 - Read in the remaining  commands, ensuring that the syntax is followed exactly as per the file.   
 - Given the volume of commands required to read in the SKLearn approach, ensure that each command is run through on a line by line basis. This will redice down drastically the chances of making keywrod mistakes in the code. Failing that, there is a hyperlink to the documentation at the start of this code block to ensure that there is the correct steps being taken.  
 - Once this analysis has been comlpeted, move on to the Polynomial analysis.   
 - Ensure that the arguement, for degree of fit, as called out in the documentation, is adhered to. Failing that , there is a hyperlink provided to ensure that this has been completed correctly.   
 - Ensure that the plotting for all three lines of best fit are completed by altering the degree of fit.   
 - Add all three lines to the one plot for best readability.   
 - Develop on the SKLEarn code block, by trying to read in the sub-packages that are called out in the code block.   
 - There are numerous aides that have been added to the start of this block of code to assist with capturing the data correctly.   
 - Unfortunately, given the technical limitations of this user, there was an inability to completely transfer the learnings from code block into the central file being created here. 
 - Conclusion  
 - Bibliiogrpahy  
 - End.
